# Weekly Tracker System: Complete Fix & Advanced Simulation Implementation

## ‚úÖ Infinite Loop Issues RESOLVED

### Root Cause Identified & Fixed
- **Cascading useEffect dependencies** between [`usePitchedItems`](src/hooks/usePitchedItems.js:17), [`useWeekNavigation`](src/hooks/useWeekNavigation.js:5), and [`useAppData`](src/hooks/useAppData.js:154) hooks
- **Solution**: Removed circular dependencies, added timeout delays, simplified state management

### Hook Optimizations Applied
1. **usePitchedItems**: Added initialization guards, prevented redundant processing
2. **useWeekNavigation**: Simplified dependencies, added timeout delays
3. **useAppData**: Streamlined data loading, prevented timestamp manipulation loops

## üîÆ ADVANCED SIMULATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED

### Full Feature Specification Compliance ‚úÖ

#### **"Simulate +1 Week Forward" Feature**
- **Visual Week Display**: ‚úÖ Advances displayed current week by one (e.g., Week 22-23 ‚Üí Week 23-24)
- **Pitched Item Logging**: ‚úÖ **PERMANENT** - Items logged in simulated week saved forever to `pitched_items`
- **Boss Clear Logging**: ‚úÖ **REVERSIBLE** - Boss clears marked with `simulated: true` flag for clean revert
- **Adaptive Navigation**: ‚úÖ Re-evaluates week navigation limits based on simulated current week

#### **"Revert Simulation" Feature**
- **Visual Reset**: ‚úÖ Returns to actual current week display
- **Pitched Items**: ‚úÖ **PRESERVED** - All pitched items remain permanently (historical data)
- **Boss Runs Cleanup**: ‚úÖ **SELECTIVE** - Removes only `simulated: true` boss_runs for simulated week
- **Navigation Reset**: ‚úÖ Recalculates limits based on real current week

### Technical Implementation Details

#### **Database Safety Guarantees**
```javascript
// Simulation boss_runs are marked and easily identified
const bossRun = {
  character: "PlayerName",
  boss: "Lucid",
  difficulty: "Hard",
  cleared: true,
  weekKey: "2025-23-24", // Simulated week
  simulated: true // üéØ KEY: Enables clean revert
};
```

#### **Revert Process** ([`performSafeRevertActions`](src/hooks/useAppData.js:254))
1. **Fetch Database**: Get current `boss_runs` array
2. **Filter Simulated**: Remove entries where `simulated: true` AND `weekKey` matches simulated week
3. **Preserve Real Data**: Keep all non-simulated boss_runs intact
4. **Preserve Pitched Items**: Zero changes to `pitched_items` (permanent historical log)
5. **UI Refresh**: Return to real current week display

#### **Data Flow Architecture**
- **Simulation State**: [`isWeekSimulated`](src/hooks/useAppData.js:332) tracks simulation mode
- **Boss Actions**: [`useBossActions`](src/hooks/useBossActions.js:18) detects simulation, adds `simulated` flag
- **Database Service**: [`saveBossRun`](src/pitched-data-service.js:57) supports `simulated` parameter
- **Clean Separation**: Real resets vs simulation resets use different functions

### User Experience

#### **Development Mode Access** (via [`Navbar.jsx`](src/components/Navbar.jsx:161))
- **"Sim W+1" Button**: Simulate one week forward with full functionality
- **"Revert Sim" Button**: Instantly return to real week with no data loss
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of simulation mode vs real mode

#### **Safe Operation Guarantees**
1. ‚úÖ **Zero Data Loss**: Pitched items permanently preserved across all operations
2. ‚úÖ **Character Safety**: Boss selections never affected by simulation
3. ‚úÖ **Clean Revert**: Only simulated boss_runs removed, real data untouched
4. ‚úÖ **Adaptive Navigation**: Week limits properly recalculated for both states
5. ‚úÖ **No Infinite Loops**: Completely isolated simulation logic

## üõ°Ô∏è System Stability

### Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced Hook Dependencies**: Prevented cascading re-renders
- **Timeout Delays**: Eliminated immediate effect chains
- **Initialization Guards**: Prevented multiple data fetches
- **Batch Updates**: Minimized database operations

### Database Consistency
- **Real Weekly Reset**: Properly clears `boss_runs`, preserves character data
- **Simulation Isolation**: No permanent changes except pitched items (as designed)
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains operation history and timestamps

The Weekly Tracker now provides a robust, fully-featured simulation system that allows testing future weeks without any risk of data corruption or system instability.
