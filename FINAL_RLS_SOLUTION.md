# Final RLS Solution - Custom Authentication System

## Problem Identified:
- **Custom Authentication**: App uses generated TEXT IDs like "UZPTJYIJ" 
- **No Supabase Auth**: `auth.uid()` returns NULL, so all RLS policies fail
- **Table Structures Confirmed**:
  - `user_data`: `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY` (custom user codes)
  - `user_boss_data`: `user_id TEXT` (references user_data.id)
  - `boss_registry`: Uses `id`, `boss_code`, `boss_name`, `difficulty`, etc.

## Solution: Disable RLS (Recommended)

Since you handle user isolation at the application level, disable RLS:

### Run these SQL commands in Supabase:

```sql
-- Disable RLS on user_data table
ALTER TABLE user_data DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

```sql
-- Keep user_boss_data RLS policies but they work for authenticated users
-- The current policies are fine for user_boss_data since they properly isolate by user_id
-- No changes needed here
```

### Alternative: If you want to keep user_data secured, run this instead:
```sql
-- Drop all user_data policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "user_data_all" ON user_data;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "user_data_select" ON user_data;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "user_data_insert" ON user_data;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "user_data_update" ON user_data;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "user_data_delete" ON user_data;

-- Disable RLS completely
ALTER TABLE user_data DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## Why This Works:
- **Application Security**: Your services already filter by user_id
- **No Auth Conflicts**: Removes dependency on Supabase Auth
- **user_boss_data**: Keep existing RLS policies (they work with your system)
- **Simplicity**: Matches your custom authentication architecture

## Recommendation:
**Run the first command to disable RLS on user_data, then test character creation.**
