# Phase 2 Refactor Summary: Weekly Clears Tracking & Pitched Items Management

## Overview

Phase 2 successfully implements the weekly boss clears tracking and pitched items management systems, building upon the foundation established in Phase 1. This phase transforms the previously stubbed functionality into fully operational systems that integrate with the new database schema.

## Objectives Achieved

### 1. Weekly Clears Tracking System ✅
- **Problem**: [`useBossActions.js`](src/hooks/useBossActions.js) was previously a stub with no database integration
- **Solution**: Full implementation using new `user_boss_data.weekly_clears` field
- **Result**: Real-time boss clear tracking with immediate UI feedback and database persistence

### 2. Pitched Items Management System ✅
- **Problem**: [`usePitchedItems.js`](src/hooks/usePitchedItems.js) was stubbed and non-functional
- **Solution**: Complete service layer with CRUD operations targeting `user_data.pitched_items`
- **Result**: Full pitched items lifecycle management with weekly filtering and statistics

### 3. Service Layer Extension ✅
- **Enhancement**: Extended [`userWeeklyDataService.js`](services/userWeeklyDataService.js) with weekly clears functions
- **Addition**: New [`pitchedItemsService.js`](services/pitchedItemsService.js) for pitched items operations
- **Result**: Consistent service-hook pattern maintained across all data operations

## New Features Implemented

### Weekly Clears Tracking (`services/userWeeklyDataService.js`)

#### Core Functions Added:
- `updateCharacterWeeklyClearsInWeeklySetup()` - Update entire clears string for a character
- `toggleBossClearStatus()` - Toggle individual boss clear status
- `clearAllBossesForCharacter()` - Clear all clears for a character
- `markAllBossesForCharacter()` - Mark all configured bosses as cleared

#### Key Features:
- **Boss Code Validation**: All boss codes validated against `boss_registry` table
- **Character Validation**: Ensures character exists before updating clears
- **Atomic Operations**: Uses upsert patterns for data consistency
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with specific failure reasons

### Boss Actions Hook (`src/hooks/useBossActions.js`)

#### Functionality:

  weekKey: "2025-05-29",         // Week identifier
  userId: "XIPOCZMI"             // User reference
}
```

### Pitched Items Hook (`src/hooks/usePitchedItems.js`)

#### Enhanced Functionality:
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Automatic sync between UI state and database
- **Week-based Filtering**: Load pitched items for specific weeks
- **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk item management
- **Statistics Integration**: Built-in yearly stats calculation
- **State Management**: Maintains `pitchedChecked` state for UI components

#### Integration Features:

- Maintains week key format compatibility

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Pattern (Extended)
```
UI Components
     ↓
React Hooks (state management)
     ↓
Services (business logic)
     ↓
Supabase Client
     ↓
Database (user_boss_data + user_data.pitched_items)
```

### Weekly Clears Data Flow
1. **User Action**: Click boss checkbox in UI
2. **Hook Processing**: [`useBossActions.js`](src/hooks/useBossActions.js) processes click
3. **Service Call**: [`toggleBossClearStatus()`](services/userWeeklyDataService.js) called
4. **Validation**: Boss code validated against `boss_registry`
5. **Database Update**: `user_boss_data.weekly_clears` updated via upsert
6. **UI Update**: Hook updates local state and triggers callbacks

### Pitched Items Data Flow
1. **User Action**: Add/remove pitched item in modal
2. **Hook Processing**: [`usePitchedItems.js`](src/hooks/usePitchedItems.js) manages operation
3. **Service Call**: Appropriate [`pitchedItemsService.js`](services/pitchedItemsService.js) function called
4. **Database Update**: `user_data.pitched_items` array modified
5. **State Sync**: Local state updated to reflect changes
6. **UI Refresh**: Components re-render with new data

## Database Schema Integration

### user_boss_data.weekly_clears
```sql
weekly_clears (JSONB): {
  "0": "DH,LH,GC",     -- Character 0's cleared bosses
  "1": "AE,PB",        -- Character 1's cleared bosses
  "2": ""              -- Character 2's no clears
}
```

### user_data.pitched_items
```sql
pitched_items (JSONB): [
  {
    "id": "XIPOCZMI-1672531200000-abc123",
    "character": "Joey",
    "boss": "Darknell",
    "item": "ET",
    "date": "2025-05-29T10:30:00.000Z",
    "weekKey": "2025-05-29",
    "userId": "XIPOCZMI"
  }
]
```

## Error Handling & Validation

### Weekly Clears Validation
- **Boss Code Validation**: All boss codes checked against `boss_registry.boss_code`
- **Character Existence**: Validates character exists in `char_map` before operations
- **Week Format**: Ensures proper `YYYY-MM-DD` week start format
- **Database Consistency**: Uses transactions where possible to maintain consistency

### Pitched Items Validation
- **Required Fields**: Validates `character`, `boss`, `item` are provided
- **User Existence**: Confirms user exists before item operations
- **ID Uniqueness**: Generates unique IDs for all pitched items
- **Week Assignment**: Automatic week key assignment for current operations

## Compatibility & Migration

### Backwards Compatibility
- **UI Components**: Existing boss table and pitched modal interfaces unchanged
- **State Management**: Maintains existing hook interface contracts
- **Animation System**: Crystal animation system fully preserved
- **Week Navigation**: Compatible with existing week navigation systems

### Legacy System Coexistence
- **Gradual Migration**: Old and new systems can coexist during transition
- **Data Format**: New services handle both legacy and new data formats
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing or malformed data

## Performance Optimizations

### Batch Operations
- **Bulk Deletes**: [`removeManyPitchedItems()`](services/pitchedItemsService.js) for efficient bulk operations
- **Upsert Operations**: Database upserts minimize query count
- **Local State Updates**: Immediate UI updates before database confirmation

### Caching Strategy
- **Hook-level Caching**: Hooks maintain local state to reduce database queries
- **Week-based Loading**: Only load data for specific weeks when needed
- **Lazy Loading**: Services only fetch data when explicitly requested

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Testing
1. **Service Functions**: Test all service functions with mocked database responses
2. **Hook Logic**: Test hook state management and callback behavior
3. **Validation Logic**: Test boss code and data validation functions
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test network failures and invalid data handling

### Integration Testing
1. **End-to-end Flows**: Test complete user actions from UI to database
2. **Week Transitions**: Test behavior across week boundaries
3. **Bulk Operations**: Test batch pitched item operations
4. **Error Recovery**: Test UI state recovery on database errors

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Boss Clearing**: Mark/unmark individual bosses, test tick-all functionality
2. **Pitched Items**: Add/remove items, test week filtering and statistics
3. **Character Management**: Test boss clears when characters are added/removed
4. **Week Navigation**: Test data persistence across week changes

## Next Steps for Phase 3

1. **UI Component Updates**: Adapt frontend components to use new hooks
2. **Data Migration Tools**: Create utilities to migrate legacy data
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement analytics for service performance
4. **Advanced Features**: Weekly reports, advanced statistics, data export
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure new systems work well on mobile devices
