# Logic Removal Summary - Pitched Item Tracking & Boss Clear Logic Disabled

## Overview
Successfully removed all frontend logic for tracking/registering pitched items and boss runs while preserving the existing UI design/structure. Database columns remain untouched. The codebase is now clean and ready for new logic implementation.

## Files Modified

### Core Service Layer
- **src/pitched-data-service.js** - Major cleanup of tracking logic while preserving utility functions
  - Removed: `savePitchedItem()`, `deletePitchedItems()`, `removeManyPitchedItems()`, `purgePitchedRecords()`, `syncPitchedItemsToCheckedState()`, `cleanupOrphanedPitchedItems()`, `clearPitchedItemsForWeek()`
  - Preserved: Data retrieval functions (`getPitchedItems`, `getAllPitchedItems`, `getYearlyPitchedStats`, `exportUserData`, `importUserData`, etc.)
  - Preserved: Boss run management functions for future use
  - Cleaned up unused helper functions and variables

### UI Components (Design Preserved, Functionality Removed)
- **src/components/BossTable.jsx** - Already properly modified
  - UI structure preserved including boss table, pitched item icons, historical week cards
  - All tracking functionality disabled (clicked handlers return no-ops)
  - Visual indicators show "tracking disabled" messages

- **src/components/PitchedItemsModal.jsx** - Already properly modified
  - Modal structure preserved with proper styling
  - Shows "Pitched item tracking disabled" message instead of tracking functionality

### Hooks (Stubbed for UI Compatibility)
- **src/hooks/usePitchedItems.js** - Already properly stubbed
  - Returns empty objects/arrays and no-op functions for UI compatibility
  - Preserves hook interface without functionality

- **src/hooks/useBossActions.js** - Already properly stubbed
  - Maintains UI-only state updates (visual checkboxes work)
  - Removed all database operations
  - Crystal animations still work for visual feedback

### Main Components
- **src/WeeklyTracker.jsx** - Cleaned up imports and functionality
  - Removed: Import of `savePitchedItem`, `removeManyPitchedItems`
  - Removed: Historical pitched modal functionality
  - Preserved: All UI structure and visual components
  - Preserved: Week navigation and boss clear UI (non-functional)

### Unmodified Files
- **src/pages/BossTablePage.jsx** - No changes needed (pure price reference table)

## Database Schema
- **pitched_items column** - PRESERVED (untouched)
- **boss_runs array** (within data JSON column) - PRESERVED (untouched)
- All database structures remain intact for future implementation

## UI Design Status
✅ **Boss table structure** - Preserved (rows, columns, layout)
✅ **Pitched item modals** - Preserved (visual structure, styling)
✅ **Detailed pitched item views** - Preserved (modal components exist)
✅ **Boss clear checkboxes** - Preserved (visual state only)
✅ **Week navigation** - Preserved (functional for UI navigation)
✅ **Character sidebar** - Preserved (all visual elements intact)

## Functionality Status
❌ **Pitched item tracking** - Disabled (no data saving)
❌ **Boss clear tracking** - Disabled (no data persistence)
❌ **Historical pitched data** - Disabled (no new entries)
✅ **Visual interactions** - Working (checkboxes, modals, animations)
✅ **Week navigation UI** - Working (displays different weeks)
✅ **Price calculations** - Working (crystal value display)

## Technical Implementation
- All tracking functions return `{ success: false, error: 'Tracking disabled' }`
- UI components show appropriate "tracking disabled" messages
- Visual state is maintained locally but not persisted
- No breaking changes to component interfaces
- ESLint errors resolved (unused variables cleaned up)

## Ready for Redesign
The codebase is now in a clean state where:
1. New tracking logic can be implemented without conflicts
2. UI design is preserved and can be enhanced
3. Database schema is ready for new data structures
4. Component interfaces are stable for new functionality

## Files That Handle Pitched Systems
These files were involved in the pitched item tracking system:
- `src/pitched-data-service.js` (core service functions)
- `src/hooks/usePitchedItems.js` (state management)
- `src/components/BossTable.jsx` (UI display)
- `src/components/PitchedItemsModal.jsx` (modal UI)
- `src/WeeklyTracker.jsx` (main integration)

## Files That Handle Boss Clear Tracking
These files were involved in the boss clear tracking system:
- `src/pitched-data-service.js` (boss run persistence)
- `src/hooks/useBossActions.js` (boss clear logic)
- `src/components/BossTable.jsx` (checkbox UI)
- `src/WeeklyTracker.jsx` (state management)
